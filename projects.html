                            focusing on creating dynamic and
                            responsive web applications. The project demonstrates skills in advanced JavaScript, modular
                            programming, and API
                            integration, along with best practices in mobile-first design and progressive enhancement.
                            Students apply these concepts
                            to build interactive, user-centered applications like the one shown in the WDD 330 Project –
